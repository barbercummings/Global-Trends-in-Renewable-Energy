# Global Trends in Renewable Energy (2000 - 2014)

## What factors influence a countryâ€™s move toward renewable energy?

- GDP / Crude Oil Price / Population
- Emission
- Energy Import
- Education

## GDP / Crude Oil Price / Population

## Emission
Doing a scatter plot clearly indicates that moving towards Renewable Energy reduces the CO2 Emission indeed. CO2 emission causes a lot of death. In 2014, it was estimated that China would have caused 1.4 million deaths in 2014 because of CO2 emission from Fossil Fuels. And US would have caused 500K deaths in 2014. So, moving to Renewable Energy would save a lot of lives.

## Energy Import

## Education
Doing a scatter plot clearly indicatres that education has no correlation with Renewable Energy. Infact, countries with renewable energy has less college enrollment.
