# Global Trends in Renewable Energy (2000 - 2014)

## What factors influence a country’s move toward renewable energy?

- GDP / Crude Oil Price / Population
- Emission
- Energy Import
- Education

## GDP / Crude Oil Price / Population

## Emission
Doing a scatter plot clearly indicates that moving towards Renewable Energy reduces the CO2 Emission indeed. CO2 emission causes a lot of death. In 2014, it was estimated that China would have caused 1.4 million deaths in 2014 because of CO2 emission from Fossil Fuels. And US would have caused 500K deaths in 2014. So, moving to Renewable Energy would save a lot of lives.

## Energy Import
We thought maybe if a country was more dependent on importing its energy it would be quicker to move toward renewable energy sources and our data did not disappoint. We began by looking at the ten countries with the highest GDP and then focused in on the group of seven countries belew 10% renewable energy in 2000. These countries have increased their renewable energy percentages over this timeframe with one exception: Russia. When it comes to energy imports Russia is also the exception. All of these countries import a significant portion of their energy while Russia is a net energy exporter. A country’s move toward renewable energy is impacted by how much that country relies on others for its energy. 


## Education
Doing a scatter plot clearly indicatres that education has no correlation with Renewable Energy. Infact, countries with renewable energy has less college enrollment.
